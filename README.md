# MEMSA

This is a multiple sequence alignment for MacOS devices.

In order to use it, MAFFT has to be preinstalled. Also, slaMEM needs to be installed into the slaMEM directory.

The code can be executed by putting an arbitrary reference sequence in the reference.fa file and putting the other sequences to be aligned in the input.fa file. The generated alignment will be written into the alignment.fa file.
